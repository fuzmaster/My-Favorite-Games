			<h1>My Favorite Games Of All Time</h1>
		</div>
		<p class="intro">These are my all-time favorite video games. This list can be described as games that I could
			play multiple times throughout the day and that I would always have time to play. Sure, there are some games
			that I have only played once and consider masterpieces, but this list consists of four games that I could
			play over and over again. That is why I believe these are my favorite games, something to which I could
			return and never look back.</p>
		<div id="entries">
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>Super Mario World</h2>
				<img src="img/Super Mario World.jpg" alt="Super Mario World" />
				<p>This is frequently mentioned as one of the first video games I ever played, but it's also one of the
					best for good reason. The level design is flawless, and the Sprite work is flawless and timeless.
					You could literally pick this up and look at it for the first time, and it wouldn't have aged a day.
					Not only that, but the nuances in the game play and controls leave it with a taste of pure ecstasy,
					making it the one SNES game I will never let go. If I could only play one game on that console and
					destroy every other one, it would be this one.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>Half-Life 2</h2>
				<img src="img/Half Life 2.jpg" alt="Half-Life 2" />
				<p>There are numerous first-person shooters that hold a special place in my heart. To name a few, I
					particularly enjoy Unreal Tournament, Serious Sam, and Halo art. No game comes close to combining a
					good story and seamless gameplay in terms of having an atmosphere that hasn't been surpassed since
					Half-Life 2. Not only does shooting various creatures and baddies in the game feel incredible, but
					the weapon variety and level design make adventuring through an apocalyptic world pure ecstasy. Not
					to mention one of the best video game weapons ever, the gravity gun, which allows you to manipulate
					any object you see and use it to your advantage. You can even finish the game with just that weapon,
					demonstrating the campaign's dedication to making it extremely replayable.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<h2>SimCity 2000</h2>
				<img src="img/Simcity 2000.jpg" alt="SimCity 2000" />
				<p>Everyone remembers their first simulation game, and the Sim franchise is well-known, possibly
					beginning with SimCity for DOS. But, for me, the journey began with SimCity 2000. It was unlike any
					other game I'd played at the time, and it made me fall in love with building massive cities all from
					my PC back then. It is still one of the most complex video games you can play today, but it ends in
					a satisfying way when it comes to creating these massive metropolises. Essentially, you are
					constructing a city from the ground up by constructing roads, zoning, various municipalities, and
					eventually Sky soaring our colleges. It's a game that still makes me want to go back and master it
					completely, understanding all of the fine nuances that Will Wright has incorporated. The Sims was
					another contentious title to include on this list, but if I had to pick one, SimCity 3000 and 4
					would take the top two spots.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<h2>Roller Coaster Tycoon 2</h2>
				<img src="img/Rollarcoaster Tycoon 2.jpg" alt="Roller Coaster Tycoon 2" />
				<p>This is another Builder, similar to SimCity, and as you may have guessed, my favorite genre is
					simulation. However, instead of a large city, you create an entire theme park. When I saw my cousin
					playing this game back in the day, I realized I was witnessing something truly unique, and I had no
					idea until later that this game was so beloved by The Gaming Community. Can you believe that this
					game was created almost entirely in assembly code by a single person? That is the dedication
					required to create such an incredible game with its emphasis on a pleasing aesthetic, accurate
					simulation of rides and Theme Park attractions, and an overall very pleasing design experience. If
					you want to play this game right now, you can get the Open Source version online, which is
					compatible with modern systems.</p>
